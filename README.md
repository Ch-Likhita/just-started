# just-started
This is my first git repo and am learning to understand the git and github .

In Github
Commit is a 2 step process
- the commit --> means the changes jo bi kiya usko tho pakka kar raha hai
- after every commit , git stores the info ( saves ur commit ) and the date you commit
- in order to change --> you add ( a change ) and then commit

Clone 
- copy the link to clone from code dropdown of the git repo
- create new folder and type `git clone [paste ur link here]`
- your git repo get's cloned into the folder

Commands
- `cd just-started` moves ur directory to ur repository [ just-started is the name of my repo, you have to type ur name there or use autotype]
- `ls` it bascially shows the list of files in ur repo or in that directory
- `ls -Hidden` shows hidden files, every git integrated file has `.git` folder to track ur changes

Status
- `git status` it shows on what brach you are on and shows if you have saved or not saved ur file [ save --> commit ]
