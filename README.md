# just-started
This is my first git repo and am learning to understand the git and github .

In Github
Commit is a 2 step process
- the commit --> means the changes jo bi kiya usko tho pakka kar raha hai
- after every commit , git stores the info ( saves ur commit ) and the date you commit
- in order to change --> you add ( a change ) and then commit
